    "## Directions Reduction\n",
    ">Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west,…\n",
    ">… a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were \"NORTH\", \"SOUTH\", \"WEST\", \"EAST\". Clearly \"NORTH\" and \"SOUTH\" are opposite, \"WEST\" and \"EAST\" too.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadfull weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!\n",
    "\n",
    ">How I crossed a mountainous desert the smart way.\n",
    ">The directions given to the man are, for example, the following (depending on the language):\n",
    "\n",
    "* [\"NORTH\", \"SOUTH\", \"SOUTH\", \"EAST\", \"WEST\", \"NORTH\", \"WEST\"].\n",
    "or\n",
    "* { \"NORTH\", \"SOUTH\", \"SOUTH\", \"EAST\", \"WEST\", \"NORTH\", \"WEST\" };\n",
    "or\n",
    "* [North, South, South, East, West, North, West]\n",
    ">You can immediatly see that going \"NORTH\" and immediately \"SOUTH\" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place! So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [\"WEST\"]\n",
    "or\n",
    "* { \"WEST\" }\n",
    "or\n",
    "* [West]\n",
    "* Other examples:\n",
    ">In [\"NORTH\", \"SOUTH\", \"EAST\", \"WEST\"], the direction \"NORTH\" + \"SOUTH\" is going north and coming back right away.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The path becomes [\"EAST\", \"WEST\"], now \"EAST\" and \"WEST\" annihilate each other, therefore, the final result is [] (nil in Clojure).\n",
    "\n",
    ">In [\"NORTH\", \"EAST\", \"WEST\", \"SOUTH\", \"WEST\", \"WEST\"], \"NORTH\" and \"SOUTH\" are not directly opposite but they become directly opposite after the reduction of \"EAST\" and \"WEST\" so the whole path is reducible to [\"WEST\", \"WEST\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    ">Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South.\n",
    "The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.\n",
    "The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {North, East, West, South}.\n",
    "See more examples in \"Sample Tests:\"\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "Not all paths can be made simpler. The path [\"NORTH\", \"WEST\", \"SOUTH\", \"EAST\"] is not reducible. \"NORTH\" and \"WEST\", \"WEST\" and \"SOUTH\", \"SOUTH\" and \"EAST\" are not directly opposite of each other and can't become such. Hence the result path is itself : [\"NORTH\", \"WEST\", \"SOUTH\", \"EAST\"].\n",
